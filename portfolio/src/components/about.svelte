"Well you can connect with on Linkedin, check my github if you want to know more about my work and education. In my free time when I am not working- I like reading books, playing guitar, taekwondo. I love meeting new people. I am full stack developer, and completing my undergraduate Bachelors degree in Computer Science at University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.
I also have started Karting as I follow F1 races. I am looking forward to watch Canadian Grand Prix this summer in Montreal in person. 
I am also working on my startup which is a food delivery system whose main point is to connect homemade cooks and small food services with university students so that the student who are far away from their house can get the home food feeling
